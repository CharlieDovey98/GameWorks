                <li>Arcade gaming
            </h3>
            <p>Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1978 by Taito Corporation, a Japanese
                company specialising in video games, toys, arcade cabinets, and game centers. It is an iconic and
                influential video game. Developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, "Space Invaders" was among the earliest
                shooting games and played a significant role in shaping the arcade gaming industry.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <li>Our game</li>
            </h3>
            <p>In Space Invaders you will control your spaceship using the Left and Right arrow keys to move
                horizontally at the bottom of the screen.
                Your spaceship has a cannon that can be fired using the space bar or up arrow key to shoot towards the
                enemy invasion.
                Your objective is to shoot at and destroy the descending rows of alien spaceships, while dodging their
                retaliatory missile fire.
                The playable area will consist of asteroids that provide temporary protection from enemy fire.
                You will start the game with three lives, losing a life every time you are struck by an alien missile.
                Once you have lost all your lives your score will be displayed and saved to the leaderboard.
                The aliens will move side to side and shoot progressively faster as you progress through the rounds
                making each round harder and harder.
                The aliens will increase in number and have more health further into the game calling for backup from
                their larger alien spacecraft.
                The last level you will face will be a boss level, with their leader present.
                This will be a formidable opponent with buffed abilities including fire rate and health.
            </p>
