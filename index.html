                Your objective is to shoot down the descending rows of alien spaceships while dodging their retaliatory
                fire.<br>
                The aliens will move side to side and shoot faster as you progress through the rounds making each round
                harder and harder.<br>
                The aliens will increase in number the further you progress through the game, as they call for backup
                from
                their larger alien spacecraft.<br>
                The last level will be a boss level with their leader present.<br>
                This will be a formidable opponent with buffed abilities including fire rate and health.<br>
                Good luck on your journey should you choose to accept pilot.
